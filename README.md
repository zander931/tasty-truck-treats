## Files Explained

In this Repository you will find all of the materials for this week of the course.

Additionally, you will find some other files that are used by VSCode:

- `README.md`
  - This is the file you are currently reading
- `.vscode` folder
  - This folder contains settings and config files for VSCode. They can be safely ignored.
- `.gitignore`
  - This file is used to tell Git what files to ignore for any changes. This can be safely ignored.
- `.prettierrc`
  - This file is used to configure Prettier, an automated formatter that we suggest you install. This can be safely ignored.
- `.eslintrc.json` and `pylintrc`
  - Used to ensure that your code is following good style guides
- `.utils` folder
  - Some config files to help us to test your code
- `.code_review` folder
  - Outputs of our automated code reviews. [See below](#code-review-folder) for more details.

Any other files found here **are relevant** for your coursework.

## Code Review Folder

Every time you commit your code to Github, we will run a suite of tests to ensure that you code is of high quality.

It's worth noting - this **does not evaluate the quality of your solution**. This of it as evaluating the 'grammar' and 'spelling' of your code rather than the actual quality of the work you've done.
