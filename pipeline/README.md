# Pipeline

This folder should contain all code and resources required for the pipeline.

### Recommendations

1. Truck #3 has the highest number of transactions (1444) and the highest total transaction value (£8470.56), indicating strong customer demand and operational efficiency. Ideally, further analysis should be done on this truck to find out what factors are optimising demand and efficiency, and hopefully translate this to the other trucks' strategies.

2. Truck #4 has the lowest number of transactions (283) and the lowest total transaction value (£770.17), showing it is underperforming both in terms of transaction volume and revenue generation. It also has the lowest average transaction value (£2.72), which could be a signal that the truck may be offering lower-priced items or has lower customer spending. In order to optimise this truck, Hiram might consider retraining staff, improve customer service, or redesigning the menu to make it more appealing. It could also be a consideration to investigate for any inefficiencies in operational costs compared to the other trucks.

3. Consider experimenting with price increases on popular menu items for trucks with lower average transaction values, to increase the average transaction value without affecting customer satisfaction, hoping to boost performance. Similarly, due to more than half of all transactions being paid in cash, you might consider offering discounts for card payments to encourage card usage. This analysis is based on the fact that significant cash usage may suggest that customers are more likely to spend smaller amounts on each transaction, and hopefully implementing this discount on card purchases may possibly increase average transaction value for the lower-performing trucks.
